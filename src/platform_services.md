### Self-Sovereign Identity

**What it is:** Manage your digital identity securely and privately, giving you full control over your personal data without relying on centralized providers. This aligns with global standards such as the W3C’s Self-Sovereign Identity framework, which empowers users to own and control their identity independently.

**Use Case:** A person applying for financial services can securely share verified identity attributes—such as name, address, and creditworthiness—directly with banks or service providers without exposing unnecessary information or depending on a central authority. This streamlines verification while protecting privacy.

### Verifiable Document Verification

**What it is:** Securely validate important documents such as degrees, patents, and legal agreements. Verified documents are tamper-proof, auditable, and legally admissible.

**Use Case:** A student applying to a university can use Contract Foundry to provide instantly verifiable proof of their previous degrees, speeding up admissions. Similarly, patent holders can register and verify intellectual property documents, ensuring authenticity and protection against fraud.

### Pledge Contract

**What it is:** Enables secure, automated payment transfers, supporting partial or full payments, milestone releases, rollback, and dispute prevention, especially suited for complex transactions.

**Use Case:** A multinational corporation working with freelancers across borders uses pledge contracts to manage large payments safely. Funds are held and released upon milestone completion, reducing risk from cross-border transaction delays, currency fluctuations, or trust issues, streamlining international freelance and business deals.

### Asset Paywall

**What it is:** Monetize your digital assets, such as e-books or exclusive written content, using a decentralized paywall controlled entirely by you.

**Use Case:** An independent book author distributes exclusive chapters or early releases directly to readers. Using Contract Foundry’s asset paywall, readers pay securely through blockchain-based payments, allowing the author to earn revenue directly without platform fees or intermediaries.

### Verifiable Credentials

**What it is:** Issue and manage W3C-compliant verifiable credentials that users hold directly in their wallets. These credentials are portable, instantly verifiable, reusable, and revocable.

**Use Case:** Many institutions—from universities to professional associations—issue digital certificates or licenses as verifiable credentials. For example, a professional license holder can instantly prove their qualifications to employers or regulatory bodies without the need for paper documents or centralized databases.

### Decentralized Identity Management

**What it is:** Authenticate and manage permissions for individuals and organizations in a decentralized manner, removing reliance on centralized identity providers.

**Use Case:** Enterprises use decentralized identity management to control employee access to sensitive systems. Employees authenticate via their self-sovereign digital identities, enhancing security and reducing risks associated with traditional password-based systems and centralized data breaches.

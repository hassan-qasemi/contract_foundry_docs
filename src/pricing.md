## 🧾 2. Account Charging System (WEI Credits)

Contract Foundry uses an internal **credit-based system** denominated in WEI (the smallest unit of ETH) to track service usage.

### How It Works:

* Users **preload credits** into their platform account (non-custodial and tracked via wallet metadata).
* Credits are used for internal operations such as:

  * Smart contract deployments
  * Credential generation
  * Subscription activation
* Credit deductions are transparent and viewable in the wallet app history.

> ⚠️ Note: These internal credits do not pay for blockchain gas fees (see next section).

---

## ⛽ 3. Blockchain Gas Fees

Gas fees—used to process transactions on the blockchain—are **paid directly from the user’s ETH wallet**. These are separate from subscription costs.

### Key Points:

* Users must maintain an ETH balance in their wallet.
* Every interaction requiring a transaction (e.g., deploy contract, update DID) incurs a gas fee.
* Contract Foundry does **not** control or markup network fees.

---

## 🔁 4. Billing Frequency and Plan Duration

Subscriptions can be activated and extended directly through the Android wallet interface.

### Options:

* **Monthly** and **Annual** plans
* Auto-expiration with option to renew
* Discount tiers for longer commitments

Enterprise customers may request:

* Invoiced billing cycles
* Bulk seat licenses
* Volume discounts based on contract and credential activity

---

## 🗑️ 5. Account Deletion and Refund Policy

Contract Foundry adheres to a **strict non-recoverability policy** to align with GDPR principles.

### Terms:

* Deleting your wallet/account removes all data permanently.
* Any remaining credit balance or active subscription is **non-refundable** and **non-recoverable**.
* This policy ensures data privacy and eliminates platform-side custody.

## 💬 6. Support and Upgrades

* Users can view their current plan and usage from the app.
* Plan upgrades are applied instantly upon payment.
* Community chat or email support is available depending on tier.

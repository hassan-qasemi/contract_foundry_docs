# Revenue and Business Model

Contract Foundry offers flexible and transparent payment options tailored to meet the needs of individuals, creators, agencies, and enterprises.

### Payment Methods

**1. Account Charges:**
Users can pay for individual services using Ethereum (ETH) through direct mainnet transactions. Each service has a specific fee charged in ETH, with network gas fees applied separately. These gas fees are determined by the Ethereum network and are not influenced or marked up by Contract Foundry. Gas fees are calculated directly from the user’s wallet (Externally Owned Account - EOA).

**2. Subscription Plans:**
For regular users who prefer predictable costs and access, we offer four subscription tiers, each designed with discounts and features tailored to different user groups:

* **Professional:** 25% discount on services
* **Creators:** 30% discount on services
* **Agencies:** 35% discount on services
* **Enterprises:** 40% discount on services

Enterprises also have the option to request custom subscription plans tailored specifically to their business needs and scale.

### Subscription and Account Management

* Users have full control over their accounts and can terminate their subscriptions or account at any time.
* Upon termination, all remaining balances and subscriptions are **immediately canceled and unrecoverable**.
* There are no hidden fees—platform service fees and Ethereum network fees are **clearly separated** and transparent.

### Network Gas Fees

* Network gas fees are set solely by the Ethereum blockchain based on current network demand.
* Contract Foundry **does not charge or influence** these fees in any way.
* Users pay gas fees directly from their own wallets when executing transactions or using platform services.

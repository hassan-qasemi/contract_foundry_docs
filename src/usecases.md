### 3. Empowering Authors with Direct Book Monetization

**Problem:**
Authors often lose revenue to gatekeeping platforms like Amazon and face distribution limitations. Traditional publishing channels take large commissions and limit creative control, making it harder to connect directly with readers.

Contract Foundry’s asset paywall lets authors sell books directly to their audience through customizable, on-chain payment systems. Authors self-host digital content and define access rules.

**Benefits:**

* Full revenue retention with no platform fees
* Direct engagement and stronger reader relationships
* Complete control over pricing, distribution, and marketing
* True independence and creative autonomy

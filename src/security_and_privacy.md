# Security and Privacy

At Contract Foundry, your privacy and security are our highest priorities. We are committed to protecting your personal information and empowering you with full control over your data.

### Data Minimalism and Transparency

We follow a strict policy of data minimalism. Contract Foundry does **not collect, store, or process any sensitive personal information** such as names, phone numbers, government IDs, wallet keys, biometric data, or user behavior. Your privacy is respected at every step.

### Local Control of Identity and Keys

All cryptographic keys, digital identities, and credentials are created and stored **exclusively on your device**. This means:

* We have **no access** to your private keys or credentials.
* Your sensitive information never leaves your device unless you choose to share it.
* If you lose your keys, they cannot be recovered by us or anyone else â€” so secure your device and backups carefully.

### Secure Authentication and Performance Monitoring

To ensure secure login and maintain app performance, we use third-party services like Firebase Authentication and Firebase Analytics:

* Only **your email** is stored by Firebase during authentication; Contract Foundry itself never accesses or stores this data.
* Performance monitoring collects only **anonymous device data** to detect crashes and improve stability â€” no personal tracking or profiling occurs.

### No Tracking or Data Sharing

We do **not** use cookies, web beacons, fingerprinting, or any tracking technologies. We do **not** sell or share user data with third parties. Your activity on Contract Foundry remains private and confidential.

### Integration with Decentralized Systems

When you choose to interact with third-party decentralized identity providers or verifiable credential issuers, these integrations are:

* Fully **optional and user-controlled**
* Managed outside Contract Foundry
* Governed by their own privacy policies and protocols

### Escrow and Dispute Management

Our escrow functionality enables trustless contract payments, but Contract Foundry does **not intervene** in disputes. Contract participants retain full control, and disputed funds or actions are paused until all parties agree.

### Content and Age Restrictions

* Use of asset paywalls for illegal or inappropriate content is prohibited and subject to user reporting.
* Contract Foundry is intended for users aged 22 and above; we do not knowingly collect data from minors.

### Ongoing Commitment

We regularly review and update our privacy practices to stay aligned with evolving technology and regulations. Any updates will be communicated clearly, and continued use means acceptance of the current policy.

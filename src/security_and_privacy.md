# 📘 Security & Privacy Model

Security and privacy are foundational principles of the Contract Foundry platform. Every interaction—whether it involves deploying a contract, signing a document, or verifying a credential—is built to preserve user sovereignty, ensure data confidentiality, and protect against unauthorized access or tampering.

---

## 🔐 1. Non-Custodial Architecture

Contract Foundry is designed as a **fully non-custodial platform**. Users maintain complete control over their private keys, identities, credentials, and funds at all times.

### Key Elements:

* **Private Keys** are never stored, shared, or transmitted.
* **All signing actions** are executed locally on the user's device.
* **Wallet encryption** is built into the official Android wallet app.

This model ensures that the platform itself never has access to sensitive user assets or data.

---

## 🔒 2. Encrypted Local Storage

The official Android wallet app stores all user data—including private keys, credentials, and contract records—in an encrypted format.

### Technical Safeguards:

* Uses secure device storage APIs.
* Supports biometric or passcode locking for local access.
* Data remains fully offline unless manually exported.

This guarantees that even if the app is compromised, encrypted user data remains secure and unreadable.

---

## 📡 3. Secure On-Chain Transactions

All blockchain interactions (e.g., contract deployments, status updates, identity changes) are signed locally and sent to the blockchain only after the user explicitly authorizes the transaction.

### Protection Measures:

* Users must approve each transaction with their private key.
* Transactions cannot be forged or replayed.
* Full transparency via blockchain explorers.

---

## 🧾 4. Immutability & Tamper Detection

Once deployed or issued, contract data and credential references become **immutable**. Any attempt to alter or falsify this information can be easily detected through cryptographic verification.

### Technologies Used:

* IPFS / Arweave for tamper-proof file referencing.
* DID-based proof metadata for verifying authenticity.
* Verifiable audit trails available on-chain.

---

## 📜 5. Legal and Standards Compliance

Contract Foundry is engineered to meet international standards for digital identity and electronic signatures.

### Supported Frameworks:

* **eIDAS**: Recognized digital signatures within the EU.
* **ESIGN**: U.S. standard for electronic contracts and records.
* **W3C DID & VC**: Interoperable decentralized identity and verifiable credentials.
* **GDPR**: Privacy-by-design system with full data deletion capability.

---

## 🗑️ 6. GDPR-Compliant Data Handling

The platform respects users’ right to **control and erase their data**. Users can permanently delete their accounts, associated DIDs (DID termination wont effects on generated signatures), and all stored credentials via the Android app.

### Key Principles:

* **Right to Be Forgotten**: Users can self-initiate irreversible data deletion.
* **No Backups or Recovery**: Once deleted, data—including subscriptions and account balance—cannot be restored.
* **No Central Logging**: The platform stores no off-chain personal metadata.

This strict compliance ensures that users are always in full control of their identity and digital footprint.

---

## 🛡️ 7. Zero Third-Party Risk

Contract Foundry introduces **no third-party intermediaries** at any point in user workflows. All interactions are peer-to-peer or self-directed using open blockchain protocols.

### Risk Mitigation:

* No central custody of user funds or identity.
* No hidden APIs transmitting data to external services.
* Trust is placed only in the open-source cryptographic standards.

---

## 🧠 8. Ongoing Security Audits and Hardening

The platform’s smart contracts and key modules undergo routine security assessments and audits. Updates follow a strict versioning and changelog process, with a focus on transparency and user trust.

### Practices:

* Periodic smart contract audits by external firms.
* Responsible disclosure policy for vulnerabilities.
* Cryptographic updates as standards evolve.

By merging strong encryption, decentralized identity, legal compliance, and user-centric design, Contract Foundry sets a high bar for trust and security in blockchain-powered business interactions.

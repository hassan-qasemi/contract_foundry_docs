# 📘 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This section addresses the most common questions from users about using Contract Foundry. If you're new to the platform or looking for clarity on specific features, you'll likely find answers here.

---

### 🔐 Q1: What happens if I lose my private key?

**A:** If you lose your private key, you lose access to your identity, contracts, and credentials. Contract Foundry is a fully non-custodial platform, which means we do not store or back up any keys. It is the user’s responsibility to securely back up and protect their keys offline.

---

### 🗑️ Q2: Can I recover my data if I delete my account or app?

**A:** No. Once deleted, all user data including user account balance and active subscription are permanently erased. This is intentional to comply with GDPR and to preserve self-sovereignty. Always back up your data and keys before clearing or uninstalling the app.

---

### 📲 Q3: Is the Android wallet required to use the platform?

**A:** Yes. The official Android wallet dApp is the only supported interface for interacting with Contract Foundry services. It is where you manage your private keys, deploy contracts, issue credentials, and store all your identity-related data.

---

### 👤 Q4: Who can use Contract Foundry?

**A:** Contract Foundry is available globally to users who are **22 years of age or older**. Users must also take full responsibility for adhering to their local laws and regulations when using the platform.

---

### 🧾 Q5: Are blockchain transactions free?

**A:** No. Any action that interacts with the blockchain—such as deploying a contract or updating a contract state or transfaring fund—requires the user to pay a **gas fee in ETH** from their wallet. Contract Foundry does not control or collect these fees.

---

### 💳 Q6: What’s the difference between platform credits (WEI) and gas fees?

**A:** Platform credits (denominated in WEI) are used to track your usage of Contract Foundry services (e.g., credential creation, smart contract deployment). Gas fees are separate and paid directly to the Ethereum network from your wallet to process blockchain transactions.

---

### 📄 Q7: Can anyone view or verify my credentials?

**A:** Only if you share them. Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Presentations are stored in your wallet and can be exported as files. They are not publicly published unless you choose to distribute them.

---

### 🚫 Q8: Can I use the Asset Paywall for any type of content?

**A:** No. You **cannot** use Contract Foundry’s Asset Paywall to monetize or distribute NSFW or illegal content. While the platform is decentralized and does not host content, **users are fully responsible** for using the system ethically and legally.

---

### 📬 Q9: Can Contract Foundry help if something goes wrong?

**A:** No. Contract Foundry is decentralized. We do not have access to your account, data, or transactions. We also do not offer cloud backed key recovery, transaction reversal, or centralized dispute resolution. All actions are final and executed directly by the user.

---

### 🧑‍⚖️ Q10: What laws does Contract Foundry follow?

**A:** Contract Foundry itself does not operate under any specific legal jurisdiction. Users must comply with the laws applicable in their own region. While the platform supports standards like eIDAS, ESIGN, and GDPR by design, it is the user’s responsibility to ensure lawful use.

---

### 🧠 Q11: Is my data safe?

**A:** Yes—if you manage it responsibly. All sensitive data is stored **locally** on your device in **encrypted form**. The app does not transmit your private keys or credentials to any central server.

---

### 💡 Q12: Can I suggest a new feature or report a bug?

**A:** Yes! You can reach out via the support contact provided in the app or on the official website. Community feedback is welcome and actively helps shape future updates.

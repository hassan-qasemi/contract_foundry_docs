# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. What is Contract Foundry?

Contract Foundry is a decentralized Web3 platform that empowers you to manage your digital identity, verify documents, and conduct secure transactions without intermediaries—giving you full control over your data and assets.

### 2. How do I create and manage my digital identity?

Your digital identity and cryptographic keys are generated and stored locally on your device. This ensures only you have access—Contract Foundry never stores or controls your private keys.

### 3. Does Contract Foundry collect my personal data?

No. We do not collect or store sensitive personal information. Some minimal data (like your email) may be handled by third-party authentication providers, but Contract Foundry itself does not access or keep this data.

### 4. How secure is my data on Contract Foundry?

Very secure. All your keys and credentials stay on your device. We do not track you, use cookies, or share your information. Plus, every transaction is cryptographically secured on the blockchain.

### 5. What payment options are available?

You can pay for services either by topping up your account with ETH for pay-as-you-go or by choosing one of our subscription plans tailored for professionals, creators, agencies, or enterprises.

### 6. Are there any fees besides the subscription or service charges?

Yes. Ethereum network gas fees apply to on-chain transactions. These fees are set by the Ethereum network and are paid directly from your wallet. Contract Foundry does not mark up or control gas fees.

### 7. Can I cancel my subscription or account?

Yes, you can cancel anytime. After cancellation, all your subscription benefits and remaining balances will be terminated and cannot be recovered.

### 8. What happens if I lose my cryptographic keys?

If you lose your keys, they cannot be recovered. It’s critical to back up your keys securely, as they control access to your identity and assets on Contract Foundry.

### 9. How does Contract Foundry handle disputes in escrow contracts?

Contract Foundry does not mediate disputes. When there is a disagreement, relevant contract functions such as fund withdrawal are paused until all parties reach an agreement.

### 10. Who can use Contract Foundry?

Contract Foundry is intended for users aged 22 and older, including individuals, creators, freelancers, businesses, and enterprises looking for secure, decentralized identity and transaction solutions.
